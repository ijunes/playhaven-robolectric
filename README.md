**A slightly modified version of Robolectric**

The Playhaven development team employs a slightly modified version of Robolectric in an extensive test suite. The team occasionally merges this internal fork with the current version of Robolectric. This project is included in the main SDK as a Maven module.

Playhaven's version of Robolectric can only be built with Maven for simplicity. Both Eclipse (with the M2Eclipse plug-in) and
IntelliJ can import the pom.xml file and will automatically generate their project files from it.
